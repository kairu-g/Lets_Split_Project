# Lets_Split_Project
Log of Let's Split Keyboard Project

The only experience I have messing with keyboards is just basic modifications such as changing keycaps and installing o-rings; the only switches I've ever used are Cherry MX Reds and rubberdomes.  This is planned to be a summer project to try building a keyboard (though not necessarily "from scratch" depending on semantics) and try new switches.
# Materials
* PCB: Joined the [Let's Split Eh? Group Buy](https://www.maple-computing.com/products/gb-lets-split-eh). Only ordered left and right PCBs, no case or TRRS cable.
* Case: Sandwich case, most likely laser cut clear antistatic acrylic from [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/) using a template that I took from nicinabox's [lets split guide](https://github.com/nicinabox/lets-split-guide) which I will be modifying.  Also need standoffs (M2 or M3, not sure yet) and rubberized legs.
* Switches: TBD, I'd like to try a tactile switch and was looking at Zealios, Zilents, and Aliaz switches as my first choice.
* Keycaps: For now, some thick pbt side printed keycaps I bought off AliExpress that are currently on my unused Corsair K65. I'd like some XDA, DSA, G20, R3 SA or similar profile caps at some point, though.
* Cables: One(1) TRRS cable and one(1) USB-C to USB-A cable are required.  I am planning on buying a [Monoprice 3' TRRS cable](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Monoprice-Onyx-Series-Auxiliary-3-5mm-TRRS-Audio-Microphone-Cable-3ft/229961580) and a [set of three 6' USB-C Cables](https://www.walmart.com/ip/EEEKit-3-Pcs-6ft-USB-3-1-Type-C-Charging-Cable-Charger-Cord-for-Samsung-Galaxy-S9-S8-S8-Plus-LG-G6-V20-G5-Nexus-5X-6P/705589637) from Walmart.  Maybe try to make one of the USB-C cables coiled too.
* Soldering Equipment: For soldering the switches to the keyboard. I will be borrowing soldering equipment my father has.
# Plans
* Get PCB
* Choose switches
* Order custom case, standoffs, rubber legs
* Order switches, maybe keycaps
* Solder switches, finish case.  Maybe I'll try something out with the bottom plate of the sandwich case; stickerbomb.
* Flash firmware. According to the group buy [reddit page](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/8f6jdn/gb_lets_split_eh_gb_is_now_live/) for the Let's Split Eh?, there should be firmware and files availible by the ship date and on the [QMK main branch](https://github.com/qmk).

Started this log, I joined the group buy on 05/14/2018. Once I figure out how to confirm that my .svg design will be compatible with the PCB, I will go ahead with the Ponoko order.
