# Lets_Split_Project
Log of Let's Split Keyboard Project

The only experience I have messing with keyboards is just basic modifications such as changing keycaps and installing o-rings; the only switches I've ever used are Cherry MX Reds and rubberdomes.  This is planned to be a summer project to try building a keyboard (though not necessarily "from scratch" depending on semantics) and try new switches.
# Materials
* PCB: Joined the [Let's Split Eh? Group Buy](https://www.maple-computing.com/products/gb-lets-split-eh). Only ordered left and right PCBs, no case or TRRS cable.
* Case: Sandwich case, most likely laser cut clear antistatic acrylic from [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/) using a template that I took from nicinabox's [lets split guide](https://github.com/nicinabox/lets-split-guide) which I will be modifying.  Also need standoffs (M2 or M3, not sure yet) and rubberized legs.
* Switches: TBD, I'd like to try a tactile switch and was looking at Zealios, Zilents, and Aliaz switches as my first choice.
* Keycaps: For now, some thick pbt side printed keycaps I bought off AliExpress that are currently on my unused Corsair K65. I'd like some XDA, DSA, G20, R3 SA or similar profile caps at some point, though.
* Cables: One(1) TRRS cable and one(1) USB-C to USB-A cable are required.  I am planning on buying a [Monoprice 3' TRRS cable](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Monoprice-Onyx-Series-Auxiliary-3-5mm-TRRS-Audio-Microphone-Cable-3ft/229961580) and a [set of three 6' USB-C Cables](https://www.walmart.com/ip/EEEKit-3-Pcs-6ft-USB-3-1-Type-C-Charging-Cable-Charger-Cord-for-Samsung-Galaxy-S9-S8-S8-Plus-LG-G6-V20-G5-Nexus-5X-6P/705589637) from Walmart.  Maybe try to make one of the USB-C cables coiled too.
* Soldering Equipment: For soldering the switches to the keyboard. I will be borrowing soldering equipment my father has.

## Cost
| **Materials** | **Price** |
|---------------|-----------|
| PCB           | $44.60    |
| Switches      | TBD       |
| Keycaps       | N/A       |
| Case          | $11.36 (after discount)   |
| Standoffs     | TBD       |
| Case Legs     | TBD       |
| Cables        | $13.67    |

# Plans
* Get PCB
* Choose switches
* Order custom case, standoffs, rubber legs
* Order switches, maybe keycaps
* Solder switches, finish case.  Maybe I'll try something out with the bottom plate of the sandwich case; stickerbomb.
* Flash firmware. According to the group buy [reddit page](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/8f6jdn/gb_lets_split_eh_gb_is_now_live/) for the Let's Split Eh?, there should be firmware and files availible by the ship date and on the [QMK main branch](https://github.com/qmk).

Started this log, I joined the group buy on 05/14/2018. Once I figure out how to confirm that my .svg design will be compatible with the PCB, I will go ahead with the Ponoko order. 

I modified the .svg from nicinabox's Let's Split Guide in Inkscape. I moved the bottom middle circle to the upper right of the main board based on pictures of the board.  The guide is based around the Let's Split v2 which is why there is not an upper right circle relative to the rectangle.

##### Let's Split v2 (top) vs Let's Split Eh? (bottom)

For some reason although the Let's Split v2 only has 4 non-switch holes, the plate design in nicinabox's guide had an extra circle just to the right of the bottom left circle. [¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯](https://qmk.fm/keyboards/lets_split/lets_split_laser.svg)

Ordered the sandwich cases yesterday, went with Abrasive Resistant Acrylic and with my discount, paid $11.36. Now need to decide on switches. Debating between Zealios or Box Whites right now, but having never experienced a tactile or clicky switch, it is hard to decide.
